						<p>Extreme Orange is a program designed to engage Clemson students using an innovative educational method that allows undergraduate students from the School of Computing and the College of Business to apply academic knowledge and skills in a real-world manner.
						The program is two semesters. The intent is that the program runs each year. For the first year, the program focuses on M2M applications and supporting infrastructure. For details, please refer to the four projects currently running under the Project section.
						The student learning outcomes include:
						<ul class="indent">
						<li>Demonstrate an understanding of network and Linux systems.</li>
						<li>Demonstrate a conceptual understanding of emerging Internet technology including Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing.</li>
						<li>Demonstrate proficiency in using open source or IBM software made available to the program.</li>
						<li>Demonstrate proficiency in design, test, and performance assessment of large complex cyberphysical systems.</li>
						<li>Demonstrate an ability to contribute in a small project team.</li>
						<li>Demonstrate basic business oriented skills including the ability to write and communicate effectively, to gather requirements and to manage complete IT projects.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Computing students are expected to demonstrate new technical skills learned during the experience. Business students are expected to successfully apply business principles to a set of technical projects.</p>

						<p>We are grateful to IBM for their generous support for this program. In addition to direct financial support, IBM has made available applications and services to our students through their ​Softlayer Cloud and their ​BlueMix Cloud application development and service platforms.</p>
