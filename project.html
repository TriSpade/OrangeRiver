									<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

								<span class="image featured"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/banner.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								
								<p>Intelligent River develops and operates hydrological observation systems to support research and provide real-time monitoring, analysis, and management of water resources. Given the importance of water as a resource Intelligent River's goal is to provide critically needed data to improve water resources management as demand increases for drinking water, hydroelectrical power, recreation, and industrial production.</p>

								<p>Orange River is the name of our group and our goal is to further advance Intelligent River's goals by working to improve Intelligent River's data. Currently Intelligent River's data does not integrate weather data, detect outliers, or perform predictive analysis.</p>
								
								<h3>Solution Statement</h3>
								<p>With this project, we want to create an implementation of cloud-based services that 
								ingest both historical and streaming data collected from the multiple sensors and sources 
								that exist in the Intelligent River systems already. These services will allow for the analytical 
								exploration of the following topics in real-time:</p>
								<ul class="indent">
									<li>Visualization of streaming data</li>
									<li>Detection of anomalies</li>
									<li>Event detection or classification</li>
									<li>Clustering of similar data points for visualization</li>
									<li>Prediction of future sensor readings or events</li>
								</ul>
