			<h3>Technical Description</h3>
			<p>Weâ€™ve used software development to create the aforementioned infrastructure 
			capable of supporting real-time decision making with the data received from the 
			Intelligent River systems. This is a way to evolve the program from the standard 
			resilient data collection into a more complex system founded on cloud and edge 
			computing for environmental monitoring and decision making. These decisions should 
			be made based on analytics of the knowledge derived from historical data.</p>
